You would never guess what can happen when you jump into a seemingly shallow puddle at night time!
It turns out that it is not a puddle rather than a giant hole which brings you to a new world on the other side of the light water. Now you are left stunning and don't know what to do.
You tried to walk, but your body was not listening to you and it was very difficult to make a step.
