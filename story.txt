You would never guess what can happen when you jump into a seemingly shallow puddle at night time!
It turns out that it is not a puddle rather than a giant hole which brings you to a new world on the other side of the light water. 
Now you are left stunning and don't know what to do.
You can't believe your eyes. There are magical creatures of all shapes and sizes in all directions!
